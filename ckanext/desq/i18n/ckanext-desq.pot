"<h2>Content</h2> The Data Portal on English-Speaking Quebec (DESQ) is a "
"growing online database created by the <a "
"href=\"https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/scpa/quescren.html\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Quebec English-Speaking Communities Research Network "
"(QUESCREN)</a> at Concordia University. DESQ stores statistical datasets "
"related to English-speaking Quebec that are mostly drawn from Canadian census"
" data. <h2>Dataset Formats</h2> Datasets are available in three formats: <ul>"
" <li><strong>Ivation tables (IVT)</strong>. These can be opened using the "
"freely available <a href=\"https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/public/beyond20-20\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Beyond 20/20 Professional Browser</a>, which works only on "
"Windows operating systems (not Mac). For a quick primer on using this "
"browser, <a "

" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</li> <li><strong>Comma-separated values "
"files (CSV)</strong>. These raw datasets can be imported into a variety of "
"programs, but typically require field formatting and some prior experience in"
" working with big data.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files "
"(XLSX)</strong>. These are the most user-friendly datasets for those familiar"
" with spreadsheets but unfamiliar with other data treatment software. "
"However, they allow for the cross-referencing of only two variables at a "
"time. Files can be opened using <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-"
"us/microsoft-365/excel\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Excel</a>, <a "

"website is currently under development and all dataset formats listed here "
"may not yet be available.</strong> <h2>Use of Material</h2> All datasets on "
"this site were created by Statistics Canada for third-party organizations. "
"They are freely available via an <a "
